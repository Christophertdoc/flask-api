Based on the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMppyAPbLYk&ab_channel=TechWithTim



### Start virtual environment

2. `source virtual-env/bin/activate`

### Install modules
1. `cd ..`
2. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Run API
1. At project root, Type `python3 main.py` in terminal and press "enter".

### Deactivate virtual environment
1. Type `deactivate` into the terminal and press "enter".

## Note:
If using VS code, you may need to click on the python version in the bottom left of the VS code window. Then select the version of Python that you're using. Next, restart VS code. This should remove some code warnings.
